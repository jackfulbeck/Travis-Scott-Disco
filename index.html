	<p style="font-family:courier;"> 
Bittsm is ranked in last place because it just isn’t memorable for me, it does have hits like “goosebumps”, I just don’t find myself coming back to it.

	3. Utopia

Utopia is ranked 3rd. It has a definite aesthetic, and has its hits as well. I just don’t think it’s as good as the higher one's on the list.

Rodeo takes second here, I think the story behind it of Travis’ life into stardom and the partylife is very interesting. Even as a debut album, I really like it. This was very close to first place.

	<p title=”Astroworld”> I have to give it up to Astroworld for the win here. I come back to it so often, every song on this album is worth listening to, and it just sounds so good.</p>
